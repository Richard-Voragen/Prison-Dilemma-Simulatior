# Prison-Dilemma-Simulatior
The situation goes that 100 numbered prisoners enter a room one by one with 100 boxes in them, each with a number in it from 1 to 100 (no repeats).<br>
Each prisoner can open 50 boxes and they must find their own number in the box. If all 100 prisoners find their number then they are all set free but if any of the prisoners fail then they are all put back in jail. Also the room is reset between each of the prisoners but the numbers are not reshuffled. <br>
The solution to this is to pick the box that has the same number as the prisoner since randomly picking boxes is extremely improbable since all 100 would have to do it correctly.<br>
This personal project program assists in finding the percentage of time that this strategy works. I also used this program to see if shuffling the boxes would reset the odds but i found it did not.<br>
